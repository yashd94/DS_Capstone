### Coursera Data Science Capstone Project


This application is the capstone project for the Coursera Data Science specialization held by professors of the Johns Hopkins University and in cooperation with SwiftKey.

#### The Objective

The goal of this capstone project is to build a Shiny application that predicts the next word on the basis of a set of input words. 

This project leverages the various methods learnt during the course of the Coursera Data Science specialization, and is a step-by-step build of a data product. Exploratory analyses, statistical modelling, and learning techniques have been implemented using various R packages. 

Data from the corpus provided [HC Corpora](http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/) has been used to create a frequency dictionary of _n-grams_ (a set of _n_ words), and this dictionary has been used to predict the next word.

#### Using the Application


Once the user enters text into the first box, as shown below, the app predicts the next word, which is then displayed in the second box below.
