# Coursera Data Science Capstone Project

This application is the capstone project for the Coursera Data Science specialization held by professors of the Johns Hopkins University and in cooperation with SwiftKey.


## The Objective

The goal of this capstone project is to build a Shiny application that predicts the next word on the basis of a set of input words.

This project leverages the various methods learnt during the course of the Coursera Data Science specialization, and is a step-by-step build of a data product. Exploratory analyses, statistical modelling, and learning techniques have been implemented using various R packages.

Data from the corpus provided [HC Corpora](http://data.danetsoft.com/corpora.heliohost.org) has been used to create a frequency dictionary of n-grams (sets of _n_ words), and this dictionary has been used to predict each successive word.
